# üõ† Development Guide

This document describes the **workflow**, **release process**, and **naming conventions** for this Unity project.  
Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistent and collaborative development.

## üö¶ Workflow
- The `develop` branch is the **main working branch**.  
- Always create a **new branch from `develop`** when starting a feature or fix.  
- Branch names **must** start with:

1. feat/{feature-name}
2. fix/{issue-name}
3. chore/{task-name}

Example: `feat/leaderboard-system`  


- ‚ùå Do **not** merge directly into `main` or `develop`.  
- ‚úÖ Always use **Pull Requests (PRs)** into `develop` and request a review from **@dhityawe**.  
- PR titles must be consistent: `Merge request from {your-branch} to develop`
- Don‚Äôt forget to update the **Kanban board** in GitHub Projects when tasks progress.

## üéÆ Releasing Game
1. Create a **Pull Request** from `develop` ‚Üí `main`.  
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new features, fixes, and changes.  
3. Once merged, the `main` branch represents the latest stable release.

## ‚ú® Naming Conventions
- Follow Unity‚Äôs common practices for naming:  
- **Scripts:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `PlayerController.cs`)  
- **Variables & Methods:** `camelCase` (e.g., `playerSpeed`, `movePlayer()`)  
- **Constants:** `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)  
- **Folders/Assets:** Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `Audio/SFX`, `Scenes/MainMenu`)  
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known (e.g., `UI`, `SFX`).
- Avoid public variables unless its properties, use `[SerializeField]` instead
